Over the past year a team at Facebook has been using machine learning algorithms to help human mappers edit and validate faster. In addition to sharing how we use OSM in product, connectivity and disaster response you can learn about the AI-Assisted Road Tracing Import currently being done in Thailand. We will talk about the tools we have created to support this effort, the lessons learned and share our next steps.
