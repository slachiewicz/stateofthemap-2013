Hello SOTM Team! 
My idea is to quickly dive into a project conducted with the European Commission on mapping the EU budget spent worldwide. Three parts: data collection troubles with public institutions, mapping result, policy impact of the mapping study. 
At your disposal to discuss this. 
Many thanks for the work you do. 
I look forward to meeting you. 
Kind regards,
Michael
