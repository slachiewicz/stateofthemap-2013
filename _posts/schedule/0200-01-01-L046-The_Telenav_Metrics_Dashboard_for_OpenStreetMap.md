Telenav&#39;s OSM team released a new OSM Metrics Dashboard earlier this year. It offers weekly comprehensive statistics on the OSM map data. Unlike other metrics views that are already available, this new tool for the OSM community is focused specifically on navigation attributes like length of navigable roads, number of turn restrictions, and signposts. What is exciting about it, is that due to the big data technologies it uses, it offers statistics for the whole world, on countries, states, counties and even some metropolitan areas. In this lighting talk we will present what the dashboard offers via a demo, as well as some insights on how it works under the hood.
