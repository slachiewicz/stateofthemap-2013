There are a lot of online services that produce nice maps from OpenStreetMap data, but only very few that generate output suitable for printing. This talk is going to present MapOSMatic, a service that produces large scale single and multi page high resolution maps.

MapOSMatic produces large scale maps in PDF, SVG or high resolution PNG format. Map data from OpenStreetMap is rendered using customizable style sheets, and optionally combined with extra textual information, like a street index for the visible area. Output can be a single page map, or a multi page book-like atlas.

MapOSMatic has been around for quite a while, but development had stalled a bit over the last years. Recently the project has been taking up some speed again. The talk will present both the basic features and some of the recent additions, programming and style sheet tweaking, and how to run your own instance.
