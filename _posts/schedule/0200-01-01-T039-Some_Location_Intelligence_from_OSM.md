CARTO (formerly known as CartoDB) has built web GIS, visualization and Location Intelligence tools for about 10 years, and OpenStreetMap has been one of the core datasets for both basemaps and some analytics. I introduce an use case for Location Intelligence harvesting OSM data. It is in technical level, using open source software tools and openstreetmap data. The open source data science toolkit is mostly around Python stack: Jupyter notebooks, adding some OSM data extracting tools, PostGIS and some CARTO tools. Via a specific global sample I&#39;ll demonstrate what marvellous new insights in the area of human geography and cultures you can get from the OSM.
