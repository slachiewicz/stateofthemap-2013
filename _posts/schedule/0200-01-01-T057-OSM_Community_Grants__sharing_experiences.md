Since 2016, HOT has provided Microgrants and Device Grants to 25 OSM communities worldwide. This talk will be co-presented by community grants recipients, to share some of their inspirational achievements on extremely little funding, to spark interest in the global OSM community on what mini grants can achieve. This talk will also share the experiences and lessons learned from setting up grants programs with OSM communities, in order to equip others to be able to support community grants program going forward.
