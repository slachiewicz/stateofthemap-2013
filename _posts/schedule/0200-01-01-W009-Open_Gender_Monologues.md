In our session, ‘Open Gender Monologues — unheard voices from the OSM community’, we want to give the stage to the success stories and challenges for women and the LGBTQ community in the OpenStreetMap space. We won’t have a fixed panel or keynote speakers. Instead, we’ll read stories from the women and LGBTQ community participating out loud (some may be anonymous), to share with the community to the various aspects of gender in this space. Attendees will also be invited to share their experiences during the session. Lastly, we will have a reflection of how we can create a better space to overcome gender disparity in our community.
