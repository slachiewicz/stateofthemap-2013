Mapping our hometown is a great feeling. It is more enjoyable when it is done in a group. The feeling is incomparable when it comes to do something for your country or community. Sometimes, some volunteers loses their interest for lack of motivation or they thinks about the benefits behind what they do. The purpose behind this session is to let them know that we don’t have to find benefit in every work because “Our work will take us forward”. Do something so that the world remembers you and you shine as the brightest star among the crowd.
