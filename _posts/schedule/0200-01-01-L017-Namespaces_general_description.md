Namespaces are already widespread in OSM, but not used in general to express details of an item. An example :
A namespace structure for shops should be described for all shops, not discussed &#34;from scratch&#34; for every single shop. The latter just leads to inconsistent data which is more difficult to use. 

New contributors will be quenched by narrow-minded querulents if the general guidelines are unclear. This will slow down the OSM development by decades (especially as the number of users is growing, even more small minded fault-finders will appear and most likely restrain constructive discussions).
