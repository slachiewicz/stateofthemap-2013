The talk will be given by Hans Hack and Sebastian Meier. The talk will focus on alternative perspectives onto our environment and space through artistic interpretations of OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. Visual cartographic representations do not only help us navigate the world, they shape our image of the world. Through our work we are challenging those perspectives by rearranging, re-contextualizing and reinterpreting OSM data and, thereby, try to go beyond standardized representations. From re-contextualizing foreign cartographies in well-known local spaces (http://hanshack.com/aleppo) to creating personal psychogeographic maps from individual&#39;s spatio-temporal trajectories (http://www.vislab.io/projects/mentalmaps). More examples of our work can be found here: http://hanshack.com/pointnemo/,
