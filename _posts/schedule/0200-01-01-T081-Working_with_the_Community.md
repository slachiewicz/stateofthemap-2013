Apple has started reaching out to the OpenStreetMap community for data projects in many countries around the world. We will share our best practices and processes for engaging with local OSM communities, which may also be helpful for others who wish to use and improve OSM data and work with the OpenStreetMap community. We will also talk about how we use a variety of openly available tools to identify and communicate with the community.
