Not sure yet. Could talk briefly about the following topics (1, 2 or a combination of the 3). I would decide closer to the date of SotM, taking in consideration more experience in coming months and what is considered interesting by organizers.

► Mapping of historic heritage sites – project presentation: mapping buildings and sites with historic importance for Mozambique. Reflecting on the challenge of tagging historical objects in OSM.

► Mapping of public transport in African cities, the case of Maputo – project presentation: mapping informal public transport. Reflecting on the usefulness of open data for better public transport management in large and highly informal cities.

► #MapeandoMeuBairro – community presentation: presenting different projects done by a new OSM community, likely the first based in Mozambique. All projects use mapping methodology that combines field with desk mapping; skilled mappers with local resident knowledge. Focus on contributing for development in low-income neighbourhoods hence the community name #MapeandoMeuBairro.
