The session will be about mental health care in the Philippines and the services available to individuals suffering from mental health issues in the country. I hope to introduce the map I have made for this cause which I called &#34;Mental Health A-WHERE-ness PH&#34;. This map shows the locations of free and paid mental health facilities and services that offer help to people with depression, anxiety, drug and alcohol dependency, etc. I also hope that through this map, which could show the reality of how the Philippines fares in mental health care, those who have the power and the means to help teach mental health awareness and improve services in the country may be made aware of this situation.
