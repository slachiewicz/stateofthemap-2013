I am part of Let&#39;s Do It! World movement. My vision is a clean and healthy waste-free world. We are now building a trash-tech platform to 10x the movement &amp; inspire the next 100s of Millions join in the World Cleanup day on 15th of September 2018. Mapping the waste beforehand helps the communities to see where all the mismanaged solid waste is located in order to prepare for the action day and mobilise people. MapIt campaign is about collecting mismanaged solid waste data through a simple app and citizen science. Most active period is from April to August 2018.
First version of the World Waste Platform http://opendata.letsdoitworld.org/ 
The overall aim of the World Waste Platform is to analyse and visualise the data, to make the waste problem visible around the world.
