In this talk, the Telenav OSM team talks about what we have learned from our experience building a horizontally scalable deep learning pipeline that can process the &gt;120 million images in the OpenStreetCam database. We will offer a technical perspective about how we used state of the art algorithms to detect a large number of traffic signs, extract road features like number of lanes visible on a road, and accurately perform text recognition on signs. This technology is now open source and available for anyone to use and improve upon!
