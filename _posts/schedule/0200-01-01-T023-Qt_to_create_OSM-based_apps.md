The aim of the talk is to introduce the mighty Qt framework (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qt_(software)) to
the audience, then to drill down into its QtLocation module.
The goal is to demonstrate the functionalities of the module and of its OSM-backed plugins (osm, mapbox, mapboxgl)
and how to easily pull together applications to do mapping, routing, geocoding and search places of interest with
the power of QML and of OpenStreetMap.
These *native* applications (as opposed to javascript-based or similar cross platform frameworks) can then be
deployed everywhere thanks to the power of Qt. This means desktop, mobile and embedded platforms.
