Navigating our cities using free software community based mobile apps in &#39;private mode&#39; might sound like an easy task in 2017, but with a little research you will be quickly disappointed. There are related platforms out there, but some of them are lacking good User Experience, others are not community-lead or are getting away from the free software freedoms due to their partnerships with companies that do not respect our privacy online. These are only some of the reasons the CityZen app was born in Tirana, as an OSM based Android app that helps us navigate our cities without tracking our location and activities. At the same time the app offers easy mobile optimized OpenStreetMap editing for easy contributions on the go. CityZen aims to be empowered by the community in terms of development and promotion and as a digital wallet for cryptocurrency used to make payments for goods and services from POIs easily through the app.
