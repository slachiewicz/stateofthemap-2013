Microsoft has been working intensively with OpenStreetMap data over the past year developing metrics, quality gates, data validation tests and other measurements to determine when and where the data meets stringent internal release criteria. We have found that in some areas, for some services the data is very, very close to being production ready while in other areas there is a long way to go. 

In this talk Microsoft will present some of the measurement criteria and how the team uses web scrapes, side by side measurements and routing tests to discover what and where the gaps are in the data and the level of effort required to close them. The team will also describe some of the challenges of bringing a highly unstructured, Open Data set in to the highly structured and process driven environment at Microsoft.
