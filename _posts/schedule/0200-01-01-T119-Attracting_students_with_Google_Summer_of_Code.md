OpenStreetMap has been participating with great success in the
Google Summer of Code program for several years. With over xxx
successful projects, we&#39;ve been able to welcome skilled students
into our developer community, and projects throughout the
OpenStreetMap ecosystem have directly benefited from code
contributions.

This talk will summarize past projects, this year&#39;s GSoC and the
future as we see and hope to see it. It will offer some insights
into how the OSMF Engineering Working Group is administering our
participation and how students can get involved. We especially
hope that this talk will help attract interested students all
over the world to join in.
