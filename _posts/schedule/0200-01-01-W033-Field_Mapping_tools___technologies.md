If you want to get started on mapping things, be it data on schools, railway crossings, street names, or something entirely different, it&#39;s good to think about the tools you intend to use first. Especially if more people get involved! In this workshop, we&#39;ll demonstrate several topics related to data collection, and get some hands-on experience on:

- Choosing what data to collect and why;
- What data collection and mapping tool to use when, such as Maps.me, OpenDataKit, or OpenMapKit;
- Creating a data model and forms;
- Establishing baseline data; review existing data (OSM Analytics and other tools), review imagery, and set up digitization tasks with the Tasking Manager;
- Collecting, reviewing, uploading and validating data;
- (If time allows, more on logistics, safety and communications)

The goal is to give an overview of several existing options and choices to make, and to get some hands-on experience with a couple of these tools!
