Based on what I did recently in the use of OSM to map advertising devices (with the idea of protecting landscapes from the invasion of advertising) :
 - See 
https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/User:Barnes38#.282015.2F2017.29_Outdoor_advertising.2FPublicit.C3.A9_Ext.C3.A9rieure
- See  (French OpenData used in 2016 in cartography to figth against a french government decree project) https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/User:Barnes38#.28end_2015.2Fstart_2016.29_Cartography_for_Paysages_de_France
- Participation to French SOTM 2017 in Avignon (1h30 session) https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/User:Barnes38#.282_au_4_juin_2017.29_SOTM_France_in_Avignon

I wish to make a summary of the OSM mapping specification (key : advertising), a summary of the way this key is used by OSM contributors worldwide, and to present new ideas to how to used OSM for protection of landscape.

 Thank you
