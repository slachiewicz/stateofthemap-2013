          <p>We will have lightning talks on all three conference days. Talks on Saturday and Sunday have been proposed in advance.</p>
          <p>There is no fix order of the talks in a lightning talk session in advance. If you want to listen to a lightning talk, please join the audience before the session begins.</p>
          <p>Space for semi-spontaneous lightning talks is available on Monday. If you have something interesting to share with everyone, please come to the welcome desk and ask our volunteers to add you to the list. Lightning talks are lightning shortâ€”five minutes only and will be recorded on video.</p>
